# MAGIC ## Automated Deployment with Databricks Asset Bundles
# MAGIC This course provides a comprehensive review of DevOps principles and their application to Databricks projects. It begins with an
# MAGIC overview of core DevOps, DataOps, continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and testing, and explores how these
# MAGIC principles can be applied to data engineering pipelines.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The course then focuses on continuous deployment within the CI/CD process, examining tools like the Databricks REST API, SDK,
# MAGIC and CLI for project deployment. You will learn about Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs) and how they fit into the CI/CD process. Youâ€™ll
# MAGIC dive into their key components, folder structure, and how they streamline deployment across various target environments in
# MAGIC Databricks. You will also learn how to add variables, modify, validate, deploy, and execute Databricks Asset Bundles for multiple
# MAGIC environments with different configurations using the Databricks CLI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Finally, the course introduces Visual Studio Code as an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for building, testing, and
# MAGIC deploying Databricks Asset Bundles locally, optimizing your development process. The course concludes with an introduction to
# MAGIC automating deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions to enhance the CI/CD workflow with Databricks Asset Bundles.
# MAGIC By the end of this course, you will be equipped to automate Databricks project deployments with Databricks Asset Bundles, improving
# MAGIC efficiency through DevOps practices.
