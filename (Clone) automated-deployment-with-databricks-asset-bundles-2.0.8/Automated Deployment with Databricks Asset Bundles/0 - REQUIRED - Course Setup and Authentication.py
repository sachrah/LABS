# MAGIC ## B. Explore Your Environment
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 1. Let's quickly explore the course folder structure and files.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     a. In the left navigation bar, select the folder icon.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     b. Ensure you are in the main course folder named **Automated Deployment with Databricks Asset Bundles**.
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC     c. In the main course folder, you will see various folders, each folder contains specific files for each demonstration or lab.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 2. Manually view your catalogs and data for this course.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     a. In the navigation bar on the left, select the catalog icon.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     b. Confirm the classroom setup script has created three new catalogs for you:
# MAGIC       - **unique_name_1_dev**
# MAGIC       - **unique_name_2_stage**
# MAGIC       - **unique_name_3_prod**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     c. Expand each catalog and notice a volume named **health** was created and contains one or more CSV files for the specific environment (development, stage, and production).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 3. Throughout the course, the following Python variables will be used to dynamically reference your course catalogs:
# MAGIC     - `DA.catalog_dev`
# MAGIC     - `DA.catalog_stage`
# MAGIC     - `DA.catalog_prod`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     Run the code below and confirm the variables refer to your catalog names.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

print(f'DA.catalog_dev: {DA.catalog_dev}')
print(f'DA.catalog_stage: {DA.catalog_stage}')
print(f'DA.catalog_prod: {DA.catalog_prod}')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## C. Generate Tokens for Authentication to the Databricks CLI
# MAGIC In this section, you will generate credentials for working with the Databricks CLI for this course.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout the course, we will use the Databricks CLI from within a notebook. Since we are in a learning environment, we will save a credentials file in the workspace within a folder called **var_your_user_name**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE: In the "real world," we recommend that you follow your organization's security policies for storing credentials. Do not store your credentials in a file.**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC View the [Secret management](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/index.html) documentation for more information on using secrets.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### C1. Store the Databricks CLI Credentials
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A token is just like a username and password, so you should treat it with the same level of security as your own credentials. If you ever suspect a token has leaked, you should delete it immediately.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For the purpose of this training, we are going to create a landing pad in this notebook to record and store the credentials within the workspace. When using credentials in production, you will want to follow the security practices of your organization. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the following cell. Notice that it creates two text fields which you will populate in the next section.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTES:** 
# MAGIC - In your organization, you do not want to store your PAT in a file. Instead, you want to use secret scopes. For the purpose of the lab, we are storing the PAT in a folder called **var_your_user_name** for demonstration purposes. Please follow all company security best practices.

# COMMAND ----------

DA.get_credentials()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### C2. Generate Credentials
# MAGIC Create an personal access token (PAT) for use with the Databricks CLI in the Databricks Academy Lab. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Click on your username in the top bar, right-click on **User Settings** from the drop-down menu, and select *Open in a New Tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. In **Settings**, select **Developer**, then to the left of **Access tokens**, select **Manage**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Click **Generate new token**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Specify the following:
# MAGIC    - A comment describing the purpose of the token (e.g., *CLI Demo*).
# MAGIC    - The lifetime of the token; estimate the number of days you anticipate needing to complete this module.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. Click **Generate**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 6. Copy the displayed token to the clipboard. You will not be able to view the token again. If you lose the token, you will need to delete it and create a new one.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** Sometimes vocareum has issues with the copy button. So highlight your PAT and copy it. Confirm it was copied successfully.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 7. Paste the token into the **Token** field above.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 8. The host value should already be populated for you.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 9. Click outside of the cell. You should see the result *Credentials stored (132 bytes written).*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 10. In the main course folder **Automated Deployment with Databricks Asset Bundles** you should see a new folder called **var_your_user_name**.
# MAGIC - **NOTE:** You might have to refresh the folder. You can do that by selecting any folder and then navigating back to the main course folder.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTES:** 
# MAGIC - Personal Access Token (PAT) must be enabled in the workspace.
# MAGIC - Typically, use secret scopes. For the purpose of the course, we are storing the PAT in a folder called **var_your_user_name** for demonstration purposes.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Run the following cell to load the credentials. These values will be recorded as follows:
# MAGIC - In the environment variables **`DATABRICKS_HOST`** and **`DATABRICKS_TOKEN`** for [authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/index.html) by the Databricks CLI used in subsequent notebooks.
# MAGIC - Since environment variables are limited in scope to the current execution context, the values are persisted to a [file in your workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/files/workspace.html#) for use by subsequent notebooks.
