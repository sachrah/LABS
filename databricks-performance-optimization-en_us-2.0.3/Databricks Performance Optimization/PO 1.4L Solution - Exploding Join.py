# MAGIC
# MAGIC # Exploding Join
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, we will be working on improving query performance on an exploding join between 3 tables:
# MAGIC - **transactions**
# MAGIC - **stores**
# MAGIC - **countries**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We want to introduce and identify spill introduced by the exploding join and gradually improve the performance of the join.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Lab Notes
# MAGIC To successfully create a exploding join that spills to disk we had to specifically turn off the following optimizations:
# MAGIC - [Predictive optimization](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/optimizations/predictive-optimization) for Unity Catalog managed tables in the **lab** schema.
# MAGIC - Broadcast joins to gradually demonstrate the performance improvements of tuning the join strategy.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default. If you use Serverless, errors will be returned when setting compute runtime properties.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC ## A. Classroom Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the following cell to configure your working environment for this course. It will also set your default catalog to your unique **labuser** catalog, and the default schema to **lab**. All tables will be read from and written to this location.
# MAGIC <br></br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** The `DA` object is only used in Databricks Academy courses and is not available outside of these courses. It will dynamically reference the information needed to run the course.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## B. Disable Caching
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the following cell to set a Spark configuration variable that disables disk caching.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Turning disk caching off prevents Databricks from storing cloud storage files after the first query. This makes the effect of the optimizations more apparent by ensuring that files are always pulled from cloud storage for each query.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more information, see [Optimize performance with caching on Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/optimizations/disk-cache.html#optimize-performance-with-caching-on-databricks).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** This will not work in Serverless. Please use classic compute to turn off caching. If you're using Serverless, an error will be returned.
